# Deterministic Pushdown Automata
# Formally defined as a septuple:
#   M = (ùë∏, ùö∫, ùö™, ùúπ, q‚ÇÄ, ùêô‚ÇÄ, ùêÖ)
# Constructed as:
#   m = PDA.new(ùë∏, ùö∫, ùö™, ùúπ, q‚ÇÄ, ùêô‚ÇÄ, ùêÖ)
#
# This implementation is an improvement over the previous for PDA
# implementation for 2 important reasons:
#
#   1. A generic deterministic PDA object where all the transition relation is
#   defined at construction. Thus it can be reused for constructing many
#   different kinds of deterministic PDAs. This also avoids hard coded
#   "state-functions" (e.g. q0, q1), the term being an oxy-moron, in our PDA
#   which is more meaningful.
#
#   2. The construction of the PDA object is expressed in the same way it
#   in the written theory form; as a heptuple. Again, this leads to greater
#   semantic clarity and consistency. An effort has also been made to stay
#   consistent with the types used, for exampl treating the alphabets as sets
#   and q‚ÇÄ as a single value. A language like ML or Haskell could really
#   improve and take more advantage of it by defining these more explicitly.
#
# Notes on attributes:
#
# Alphabets can be defined either explicitly by the set using an array or by
# construction, like with set builder notation, using a lambda of conditionals.
#
# The stack alphabet can be defined as an array or a hash, which allows us to
# sneak in our matching characters (y') for a matching PDA. In that case it's
# also important to exclude both the stack alphabet and the matching characters
# from the input alphabet. In its current implementation, this necessary in
# order to be deterministic.
#
# The transition relation is passed in as a set of tuples which reflects the
# following function:
#   ùúπ:ùë∏ x ùö∫ x ùö™* -> P(ùë∏ x ùö™*)
#
#   For the matching PDA:
#   ùúπ(q_i, (x or y or y'), (z or ‚ä•)) = (q_j, (yz or Œª))
#
