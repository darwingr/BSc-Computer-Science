# Introduction
Contained in this repository is a selection of my completed work from classroom
assignments and lab submissions of as part of my bachelor's degree in computer
science at [St. Francis Xavier University](https://www.stfx.ca). I've documented
this as a record of work and knowledge during my years at University(2017â€“2020),
which is valuable in the place of a record of employment in software for that
time.
