Students of St. Francis Xavier University may not read, possess, run or copy
all or any part of this work. Doing so would be stealing an education from
you and I won't be a participant to that. Please, speak with your professors,
they want to help you and to see you succeed. Do so early and often.
You will learn lots from them and constant contact will help you build
discipline and relationships.
