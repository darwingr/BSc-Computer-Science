## Q1. Huffman Trees
Given the following symbols and its frequency in an organization, construct
the Huffman tree and generate the Huffman code for following the symbols:

Symbols       A      B      C      D      E
---------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Frequency    0.39   0.09   0.12   0.18   0.22

Submit the Huffman tree and the Huffman code for the symbols in question 1.

### Huffman Code

Result : `0.10.110.1110.1111`

See console sample for computed result.
