# Questions
You should measure and report the following interesting quantities:

  1. Explain your choice of distribution of the particles over the processors. Is there an optimal relation between the distribution and the geometry of the domain? Measure this by counting particles passed between processors in each time step.

  2. What is the speedup with 1, 2, 4, 16, 32,... processors.

  3. What is the scaled speedup (let the number of particles grow proportional to the number of processors).

  4. Verify the gas law pV = nRT by changing the number of particles (n) and size of the box (V ) and then measure the pressure.

  5. Bonus Project: Implement a big and heavy particle and plot the trajectory of it. This kind of motion is called Brownian motion and was found by a biologist studying the motion of pollen on the water surface in a bucket. This is also a example of a random walk and fractal by nature.
