# Pi Calculation

## Q1. Any speedup or unusual changes?

![Console screenshot of multiple executions of `parpi` under MPI with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 96 compute nodes respectively.](assets/make-sample_parpi_extended-cluster.png){ width=80% }


## Q2. Observations after doubling `NUM_STEPS`

![Console screenshot of *parpi* running over 96 compute nodes regularly then again with a doubling of `NUM_STEPS`.](assets/make-run1_run2-cluster.png)

![For the sake of interest, here is the console sample identical to that found in Q1, but with `NUM_STEPS` also doubled.](assets/make-sample_parpi2_extended-cluster.png){ width=80% }
